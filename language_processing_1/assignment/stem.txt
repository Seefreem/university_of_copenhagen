The
Legend
of
Sleep
Hollow

Irv
FOUND
AMONG
THE
PAPERS
OF
THE
LATE
DIEDRICH
KNICKERBOCK
.
A
pleas
land
of
drows
head
it
was
,
Of
dreams
that
wave
before
the
half-shut
eye
;
And
of
ga
castles
in
the
clouds
that
pass
,
Forev

CASTLE
OF
INDOLENCE
.
In
the
bosom
of
one
of
those
spac
coves
which
indent
the
eastern
shore
of
the
Hudson
,
at
that
broad
expans
of
the
riv
denominat
b
the
ancient
Dutch
navigators
the
Tappan
Z
,
and
where
the
always
prudentl
shorten
sail
and
implor
the
protect
of
St
.
Nicholas
wh
the
cross
,
there
lies
a
small
market
town

rur
port
,
which
b
some
is
call
Greensburgh
,
but
which
is
more
generall
and
properl
known
b
the
name
of
Tarr
Town
.
This
name
was
giv
,
we
are
told
,
in
form
days
,
b
the
good
housewives
of
the
adjacent
countr
,
from
the
inveterate
propens
of
their
husbands
to
ling
about
the
village
tavern
on
market
days
.
Be
that
as
it
ma
,
I
do
not
vouch
f
the
fact
,
but
merel
advert
to
it
,
f
the
sake
of
be
prec
and
authent
.
Not
far
from
this
village
,
perhaps
about
two
miles
,
there
is
a
little
valle

rath
lap
of
land
among
high
hills
,
which
is
one
of
the
quietest
places
in
the
whole
world
.
A
small
brook
glides
through
it
,
wi
just
murmur
enough
to
lull
one
to
repose
;
and
the
occasion
whistle
of
a
quail

tapp
of
a
woodpeck
is
almost
the
onl
sound
that
ev
breaks
in
upon
the
uniform
tranquill
.
I
recollect
that
,
wh
a
stripl
,
m
first
exploit
in
squirrel-shoot
was
in
a
grove
of
tall
walnut-trees
that
shades
one
side
of
the
valle
.
I
had
wander
into
it
at
noontime
,
wh
all
nature
is
peculiarl
quiet
,
and
was
startl
b
the
roar
of
m
own
gun
,
as
it
broke
the
Sabba
still
around
and
was
prolong
and
reverberat
b
the
angr
echoes
.
If
ev
I
should
wish
f
a
retreat
whith
I
might
ste
from
the
world
and
its
distractions
,
and
dream
quietl
awa
the
remn
of
a
troubl
life
,
I
know
of
none
more
promis
than
this
little
valle
.
From
the
list
repose
of
the
place
,
and
the
peculiar
charact
of
its
inhabitants
,
who
are
descendants
from
the
origin
Dutch
settlers
,
this
sequester
gl
has
long
be
known
b
the
name
of
SLEEP
HOLLOW
,
and
its
rust
lads
are
call
the
Sleep
Hollow
Boys
throughout
all
the
neighbor
countr
.
A
drows
,
dream
influence
seems
to
hang
ov
the
land
,
and
to
pervade
the
ver
atmosphere
.
Some
sa
that
the
place
was
bewitch
b
a
High
German
doct
,
dur
the
earl
days
of
the
settle
;
others
,
that
an
old
Indian
chief
,
the
prophet

wizard
of
his
tribe
,
held
his
powwows
there
before
the
countr
was
discover
b
Mast
Hendrick
Hudson
.
Certain
it
is
,
the
place
still
continues
und
the
swa
of
some
witch
pow
,
that
holds
a
spell
ov
the
minds
of
the
good
people
,
caus
them
to
walk
in
a
continu
reverie
.
The
are
giv
to
all
kinds
of
marvell
beliefs
,
are
subject
to
trances
and
visions
,
and
frequentl
s
strange
sights
,
and
hear
mus
and
voices
in
the
air
.
The
whole
neighborhood
abounds
wi
loc
tales
,
haunt
spots
,
and
twilight
superstitions
;
stars
shoot
and
meteors
glare
often
across
the
valle
than
in
an
oth
part
of
the
countr
,
and
the
nightmare
,
wi
h
whole
ninefold
,
seems
to
make
it
the
favorite
scene
of
h
gambols
.
The
domin
spirit
,
howev
,
that
haunts
this
enchant
reg
,
and
seems
to
be
commander-in-chief
of
all
the
powers
of
the
air
,
is
the
apparit
of
a
figure
on
horseback
,
without
a
head
.
It
is
said
b
some
to
be
the
ghost
of
a
Hessian
troop
,
whose
head
had
be
carri
awa
b
a
cannon-ball
,
in
some
name
battle
dur
the
Revolution
War
,
and
who
is
ev
and
anon
se
b
the
countr
folk
hurry
along
in
the
gloom
of
night
,
as
if
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
.
His
haunts
are
not
confin
to
the
valle
,
but
extend
at
times
to
the
adjacent
roads
,
and
especiall
to
the
vicin
of
a
church
at
no
great
distance
.
Inde
,
certain
of
the
most
authent
historians
of
those
parts
,
who
have
be
care
in
collect
and
collat
the
float
facts
concern
this
spectre
,
allege
that
the
bod
of
the
troop
hav
be
buri
in
the
churchyard
,
the
ghost
rides
for
to
the
scene
of
battle
in
nightl
quest
of
his
head
,
and
that
the
rush
spe
wi
which
he
sometimes
passes
along
the
Hollow
,
like
a
midnight
blast
,
is
ow
to
his
be
belat
,
and
in
a
hurr
to
get
back
to
the
churchyard
before
daybreak
.
Such
is
the
gener
purport
of
this
legend
superstit
,
which
has
furnish
materials
f
man
a
wild
stor
in
that
reg
of
shadows
;
and
the
spectre
is
known
at
all
the
countr
firesides
,
b
the
name
of
the
Head
Horseman
of
Sleep
Hollow
.
It
is
remark
that
the
vision
propens
I
have
mention
is
not
confin
to
the
nat
inhabitants
of
the
valle
,
but
is
unconsciousl
imbib
b
ever
one
who
resides
there
f
a
time
.
Howev
wide
awake
the
ma
have
be
before
the
enter
that
sleep
reg
,
the
are
sure
,
in
a
little
time
,
to
inhale
the
witch
influence
of
the
air
,
and
begin
to
grow
imaginat
,
to
dream
dreams
,
and
s
apparitions
.
I
ment
this
peace
spot
wi
all
poss
laud
,
f
it
is
in
such
little
retir
Dutch
valleys
,
found
here
and
there
embosom
in
the
great
State
of
New
York
,
that
populat
,
manners
,
and
customs
remain
fix
,
while
the
great
torrent
of
migrat
and
improve
,
which
is
mak
such
incess
changes
in
oth
parts
of
this
rest
countr
,
sweeps
b
them
unobserv
.
The
are
like
those
little
nooks
of
still
wat
,
which
bord
a
rapid
stream
,
where
we
ma
s
the
straw
and
bubble
rid
quietl
at
anch
,

slowl
revolv
in
their
mim
harb
,
undisturb
b
the
rush
of
the
pass
current
.
Though
man
years
have
elaps
since
I
trod
the
drows
shades
of
Sleep
Hollow
,
yet
I
quest
wheth
I
should
not
still
find
the
same
trees
and
the
same
families
vegetat
in
its
shelter
bosom
.
In
this
by-place
of
nature
there
abode
,
in
a
remote
period
of
American
histor
,
that
is
to
sa
,
some
thirt
years
since
,
a
worth
wight
of
the
name
of
Ichabod
Crane
,
who
sojourn
,

,
as
he
express
it
,
“tarried,”
in
Sleep
Hollow
,
f
the
purpose
of
instruct
the
childr
of
the
vicin
.
He
was
a
nat
of
Connecticut
,
a
State
which
supplies
the
Un
wi
pioneers
f
the
mind
as
well
as
f
the
forest
,
and
sends
for
yearl
its
legions
of
fronti
woodm
and
countr
schoolmasters
.
The
cognom
of
Crane
was
not
inapplic
to
his
person
.
He
was
tall
,
but
exceedingl
lank
,
wi
narrow
shoulders
,
long
arms
and
legs
,
hands
that
dangl
a
mile
out
of
his
sleeves
,
feet
that
might
have
serv
f
shovels
,
and
his
whole
frame
most
loosel
hung
togeth
.
His
head
was
small
,
and
flat
at
top
,
wi
huge
ears
,
large
gre
glass
eyes
,
and
a
long
snipe
nose
,
so
that
it
look
like
a
weather-cock
perch
upon
his
spindle
neck
to
tell
which
wa
the
wind
blew
.
To
s
him
strid
along
the
profile
of
a
hill
on
a
wind
da
,
wi
his
clothes
bagg
and
flutter
about
him
,
one
might
have
mistak
him
f
the
genius
of
famine
descend
upon
the
ear
,

some
scarecrow
elop
from
a
cornfield
.
His
schoolhouse
was
a
low
build
of
one
large
room
,
rudel
construct
of
logs
;
the
windows
partl
glaz
,
and
partl
patch
wi
leaves
of
old
copybooks
.
It
was
most
ingeniousl
secur
at
vac
hours
,
b
a
withe
twist
in
the
handle
of
the
do
,
and
stakes
set
against
the
window
shutters
;
so
that
though
a
thief
might
get
in
wi
perfect
ease
,
he
would
find
some
embarrass
in
gett
out
,--an
idea
most
probabl
borrow
b
the
architect
,
Yost
Van
Hout
,
from
the
myster
of
an
eelpot
.
The
schoolhouse
stood
in
a
rath
lonel
but
pleas
situat
,
just
at
the
foot
of
a
wood
hill
,
wi
a
brook
runn
close
b
,
and
a
formid
birch-tr
grow
at
one
end
of
it
.
From
hence
the
low
murmur
of
his
pupils
’
voices
,
conn
ov
their
lessons
,
might
be
heard
in
a
drows
summ
’s
da
,
like
the
hum
of
a
beeh
;
interrupt
now
and
th
b
the
authoritat
voice
of
the
mast
,
in
the
tone
of
menace

command
,

,
peradventure
,
b
the
appall
sound
of
the
birch
,
as
he
urg
some
tard
loiter
along
the
flower
pa
of
knowledge
.
Tru
to
sa
,
he
was
a
conscient
man
,
and
ev
bore
in
mind
the
gold
maxim
,
“Spare
the
rod
and
spoil
the
child
.”
Ichabod
Crane
’s
scholars
certainl
were
not
spoil
.
I
would
not
have
it
imagin
,
howev
,
that
he
was
one
of
those
cruel
potentates
of
the
school
who
jo
in
the
smart
of
their
subjects
;
on
the
contr
,
he
administer
justice
wi
discriminat
rath
than
sever
;
tak
the
burd
off
the
backs
of
the
weak
,
and
lay
it
on
those
of
the
strong
.
Your
mere
pun
stripl
,
that
winc
at
the
least
flourish
of
the
rod
,
was
pass
b
wi
indulgence
;
but
the
claims
of
justice
were
satisfi
b
inflict
a
double
port
on
some
little
tough
wrong-head
,
broad-skirt
Dutch
urchin
,
who
sulk
and
swell
and
grew
dogg
and
sull
benea
the
birch
.
All
this
he
call
“do
his
dut
b
their
parents
;”
and
he
nev
inflict
a
chastise
without
follow
it
b
the
assurance
,
so
consolator
to
the
smart
urchin
,
that
“he
would
rememb
it
and
thank
him
f
it
the
longest
da
he
had
to
l
.”
Wh
school
hours
were
ov
,
he
was
ev
the
compan
and
playmate
of
the
larg
boys
;
and
on
holida
afternoons
would
convo
some
of
the
small
ones
home
,
who
happen
to
have
prett
sisters
,

good
housewives
f
mothers
,
not
f
the
comforts
of
the
cupboard
.
Inde
,
it
behoov
him
to
keep
on
good
terms
wi
his
pupils
.
The
revenue
aris
from
his
school
was
small
,
and
would
have
be
scarcel
sufficient
to
furnish
him
wi
dail
bread
,
f
he
was
a
huge
feed
,
and
,
though
lank
,
had
the
dilat
powers
of
an
anaconda
;
but
to
help
out
his
maintenance
,
he
was
,
accord
to
countr
custom
in
those
parts
,
board
and
lodg
at
the
houses
of
the
farmers
whose
childr
he
instruct
.
Wi
these
he
liv
successivel
a
week
at
a
time
,
thus
go
the
rounds
of
the
neighborhood
,
wi
all
his
worldl
effects
ti
up
in
a
cotton
handkerchief
.
That
all
this
might
not
be
too
oner
on
the
purses
of
his
rust
patrons
,
who
are
apt
to
consid
the
costs
of
school
a
griev
burd
,
and
schoolmasters
as
mere
drones
,
he
had
var
ways
of
render
himself
bo
use
and
agree
.
He
assist
the
farmers
occasionall
in
the
light
labors
of
their
farms
,
help
to
make
ha
,
mend
the
fences
,
took
the
horses
to
wat
,
drove
the
cows
from
pasture
,
and
cut
wood
f
the
wint
fire
.
He
laid
aside
,
too
,
all
the
domin
dign
and
absolute
swa
wi
which
he
lord
it
in
his
little
empire
,
the
school
,
and
became
wonderfull
gentle
and
ingratiat
.
He
found
fav
in
the
eyes
of
the
mothers
b
pett
the
childr
,
particularl
the
youngest
;
and
like
the
l
bold
,
which
whilom
so
magnanimousl
the
lamb
did
hold
,
he
would
sit
wi
a
child
on
one
kn
,
and
rock
a
cradle
wi
his
foot
f
whole
hours
togeth
.
In
addit
to
his
oth
vocations
,
he
was
the
singing-mast
of
the
neighborhood
,
and
pick
up
man
bright
shillings
b
instruct
the
young
folks
in
psalmod
.
It
was
a
matt
of
no
little
van
to
him
on
Sundays
,
to
take
his
stat
in
front
of
the
church
galler
,
wi
a
band
of
chos
singers
;
where
,
in
his
own
mind
,
he
completel
carri
awa
the
palm
from
the
parson
.
Certain
it
is
,
his
voice
resound
far
above
all
the
rest
of
the
congregat
;
and
there
are
peculiar
quavers
still
to
be
heard
in
that
church
,
and
which
ma
ev
be
heard
half
a
mile
off
,
quite
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
millpond
,
on
a
still
Sunda
morn
,
which
are
said
to
be
legitimatel
descend
from
the
nose
of
Ichabod
Crane
.
Thus
,
b
divers
little
makeshifts
,
in
that
ingen
wa
which
is
commonl
denominat
“b
hook
and
b
crook
,”
the
worth
pedagogue
got
on
tolerabl
enough
,
and
was
thought
,
b
all
who
understood
noth
of
the
lab
of
headwork
,
to
have
a
wonderfull
eas
life
of
it
.
The
schoolmast
is
generall
a
man
of
some
importance
in
the
female
circle
of
a
rur
neighborhood
;
be
consider
a
kind
of
idle
,
gentlemanlike
personage
,
of
vastl
superi
taste
and
accomplishments
to
the
rough
countr
swains
,
and
,
inde
,
inferi
in
learn
onl
to
the
parson
.
His
appearance
,
therefore
,
is
apt
to
occas
some
little
stir
at
the
tea-t
of
a
farmhouse
,
and
the
addit
of
a
supernumer
dish
of
cakes

sweetmeats
,

,
peradventure
,
the
parade
of
a
silv
teapot
.
Our
man
of
letters
,
therefore
,
was
peculiarl
happ
in
the
smiles
of
all
the
countr
damsels
.
How
he
would
figure
among
them
in
the
churchyard
,
betwe
services
on
Sundays
;
gather
grapes
f
them
from
the
wild
vines
that
overran
the
surround
trees
;
recit
f
their
amuse
all
the
epitaphs
on
the
tombstones
;

saunter
,
wi
a
whole
bev
of
them
,
along
the
banks
of
the
adjacent
millpond
;
while
the
more
bash
countr
bumpkins
hung
sheepishl
back
,
envy
his
superi
elegance
and
address
.
From
his
half-itiner
life
,
also
,
he
was
a
kind
of
travell
gazette
,
carry
the
whole
budget
of
loc
gossip
from
house
to
house
,
so
that
his
appearance
was
always
greet
wi
satisfact
.
He
was
,
moreov
,
esteem
b
the
wom
as
a
man
of
great
erudit
,
f
he
had
read
sever
books
quite
through
,
and
was
a
perfect
mast
of
Cotton
Math
’s
“Histor
of
New
England
Witchcraft
,”
in
which
,
b
the
wa
,
he
most
firml
and
potentl
believ
.
He
was
,
in
fact
,
an
odd
mixture
of
small
shrewd
and
simple
credul
.
His
appetite
f
the
marvell
,
and
his
powers
of
digest
it
,
were
equall
extraordin
;
and
bo
had
be
increas
b
his
residence
in
this
spell-bound
reg
.
No
tale
was
too
gross

monstr
f
his
capac
swallow
.
It
was
oft
his
delight
,
aft
his
school
was
dismiss
in
the
afternoon
,
to
stretch
himself
on
the
rich
b
of
clov
border
the
little
brook
that
whimper
b
his
schoolhouse
,
and
there
con
ov
old
Math
’s
dire
tales
,
until
the
gather
dusk
of
even
made
the
print
page
a
mere
mist
before
his
eyes
.
Th
,
as
he
wend
his
wa
b
swamp
and
stream
and
aw
woodland
,
to
the
farmhouse
where
he
happen
to
be
quarter
,
ever
sound
of
nature
,
at
that
witch
hour
,
flutter
his
excit
imaginat
,--the
moan
of
the
whip-poor-will
from
the
hillside
,
the
bod
cr
of
the
tr
toad
,
that
harbing
of
storm
,
the
dre
hoot
of
the
screech
owl
,

the
sudd
rustl
in
the
thicket
of
birds
frighten
from
their
roost
.
The
fireflies
,
too
,
which
sparkl
most
vividl
in
the
darkest
places
,
now
and
th
startl
him
,
as
one
of
uncommon
bright
would
stream
across
his
pa
;
and
if
,
b
chance
,
a
huge
blockhead
of
a
beetle
came
wing
his
blunder
flight
against
him
,
the
po
varlet
was
read
to
g
up
the
ghost
,
wi
the
idea
that
he
was
struck
wi
a
witch
’s
tok
.
His
onl
resource
on
such
occasions
,
eith
to
drown
thought

dr
awa
evil
spirits
,
was
to
s
psalm
tunes
and
the
good
people
of
Sleep
Hollow
,
as
the
sat
b
their
doors
of
an
even
,
were
oft
fill
wi
awe
at
hear
his
nas
melod
,
“in
link
sweet
long
drawn
out
,”
float
from
the
dist
hill
,

along
the
dusk
road
.
Anoth
of
his
sources
of
fear
pleasure
was
to
pass
long
wint
evenings
wi
the
old
Dutch
wives
,
as
the
sat
spinn
b
the
fire
,
wi
a
row
of
apples
roast
and
splutter
along
the
hear
,
and
list
to
their
marvell
tales
of
ghosts
and
goblins
,
and
haunt
fields
,
and
haunt
brooks
,
and
haunt
bridges
,
and
haunt
houses
,
and
particularl
of
the
head
horseman
,

Gallop
Hessian
of
the
Hollow
,
as
the
sometimes
call
him
.
He
would
delight
them
equall
b
his
anecdotes
of
witchcraft
,
and
of
the
dire
omens
and
portent
sights
and
sounds
in
the
air
,
which
prevail
in
the
earli
times
of
Connecticut
;
and
would
fright
them
woefull
wi
speculations
upon
comets
and
shoot
stars
;
and
wi
the
alarm
fact
that
the
world
did
absolutel
turn
round
,
and
that
the
were
half
the
time
topsy-turv
!
But
if
there
was
a
pleasure
in
all
this
,
while
snugl
cuddl
in
the
chimne
corn
of
a
chamb
that
was
all
of
a
rudd
glow
from
the
crackl
wood
fire
,
and
where
,
of
course
,
no
spectre
dar
to
show
its
face
,
it
was
dearl
purchas
b
the
terrors
of
his
subsequent
walk
homewards
.
What
fear
shapes
and
shadows
beset
his
pa
,
amidst
the
dim
and
ghastl
glare
of
a
snow
night
!
Wi
what
wist
look
did
he
eye
ever
trembl
ra
of
light
stream
across
the
waste
fields
from
some
dist
window
!
How
oft
was
he
appall
b
some
shrub
cover
wi
snow
,
which
,
like
a
sheet
spectre
,
beset
his
ver
pa
!
How
oft
did
he
shrink
wi
curdl
awe
at
the
sound
of
his
own
steps
on
the
frost
crust
benea
his
feet
;
and
dread
to
look
ov
his
should
,
lest
he
should
behold
some
uncou
be
tramp
close
behind
him
!
And
how
oft
was
he
thrown
into
complete
disma
b
some
rush
blast
,
howl
among
the
trees
,
in
the
idea
that
it
was
the
Gallop
Hessian
on
one
of
his
nightl
scourings
!
All
these
,
howev
,
were
mere
terrors
of
the
night
,
phantoms
of
the
mind
that
walk
in
dark
;
and
though
he
had
se
man
spectres
in
his
time
,
and
be
more
than
once
beset
b
Satan
in
divers
shapes
,
in
his
lonel
perambulations
,
yet
daylight
put
an
end
to
all
these
evils
;
and
he
would
have
pass
a
pleas
life
of
it
,
in
despite
of
the
Devil
and
all
his
works
,
if
his
pa
had
not
be
cross
b
a
be
that
causes
more
perplex
to
mort
man
than
ghosts
,
goblins
,
and
the
whole
race
of
witches
put
togeth
,
and
that
was
--a
woman
.
Among
the
music
disciples
who
assembl
,
one
even
in
each
week
,
to
rece
his
instructions
in
psalmod
,
was
Katrina
Van
Tassel
,
the
daught
and
onl
child
of
a
substanti
Dutch
farm
.
She
was
a
bloom
lass
of
fresh
eighte
;
plump
as
a
partridge
;
ripe
and
melt
and
rosy-cheek
as
one
of
h
fath
’s
peaches
,
and
universall
fam
,
not
merel
f
h
beaut
,
but
h
vast
expectations
.
She
was
with
a
little
of
a
coquette
,
as
might
be
perceiv
ev
in
h
dress
,
which
was
a
mixture
of
ancient
and
modern
fashions
,
as
most
suit
to
set
off
h
charms
.
She
wore
the
ornaments
of
pure
yellow
gold
,
which
h
great-great-grandmoth
had
brought
ov
from
Saardam
;
the
tempt
stomach
of
the
old
time
,
and
with
a
provokingl
short
petticoat
,
to
displa
the
prettiest
foot
and
ankle
in
the
countr
round
.
Ichabod
Crane
had
a
soft
and
foolish
heart
towards
the
sex
;
and
it
is
not
to
be
wonder
at
that
so
tempt
a
morsel
soon
found
fav
in
his
eyes
,
more
especiall
aft
he
had

Old
Baltus
Van
Tassel
was
a
perfect
picture
of
a
thriv
,
content
,
liberal-heart
farm
.
He
seldom
,
it
is
true
,
sent
eith
his
eyes

his
thoughts
beyond
the
boundaries
of
his
own
farm
;
but
within
those
everyth
was
snug
,
happ
and
well-condition
.
He
was
satisfi
wi
his
weal
,
but
not
proud
of
it
;
and
piqu
himself
upon
the
heart
abundance
,
rath
than
the
style
in
which
he
liv
.
His
stronghold
was
situat
on
the
banks
of
the
Hudson
,
in
one
of
those
gre
,
shelter
,
fertile
nooks
in
which
the
Dutch
farmers
are
so
fond
of
nestl
.
A
great
elm
tr
spread
its
broad
branches
ov
it
,
at
the
foot
of
which
bubbl
up
a
spr
of
the
softest
and
sweetest
wat
,
in
a
little
well
form
of
a
barrel
;
and
th
stole
sparkl
awa
through
the
grass
,
to
a
neighbor
brook
,
that
babbl
along
among
alders
and
dwarf
willows
.
Hard
b
the
farmhouse
was
a
vast
barn
,
that
might
have
serv
f
a
church
;
ever
window
and
crevice
of
which
seem
burst
for
wi
the
treasures
of
the
farm
;
the
flail
was
busil
resound
within
it
from
morn
to
night
;
swallows
and
martins
skimm
twitter
about
the
eaves
;
and
rows
of
pigeons
,
some
wi
one
eye
turn
up
,
as
if
watch
the
weath
,
some
wi
their
heads
und
their
wings

buri
in
their
bosoms
,
and
others
swell
,
and
coo
,
and
bow
about
their
dames
,
were

the
sunshine
on
the
roof
.
Sleek
unwield
porkers
were
grunt
in
the
repose
and
abundance
of
their
pens
,
from
whence
salli
for
,
now
and
th
,
troops
of
suck
pigs
,
as
if
to
snuff
the
air
.
A
statel
squadron
of
snow
geese
were
rid
in
an
adjoin
pond
,
convoy
whole
fleets
of
ducks
;
regiments
of
turkeys
were
gobbl
through
the
farmyard
,
and
Guinea
fowls
frett
about
it
,
like
ill-temper
housewives
,
wi
their
peevish

discontent

Before
the
barn
do
strutt
the
gall
cock
,
that
pattern
of
a
husband
,
a
warri
and
a
fine
gentleman
,
clapp
his
burnish
wings
and
crow
in
the
pride
and
glad
of
his
heart
,--sometimes
tear
up
the
ear
wi
his

,
and
th
generousl
call
his
ever-hungr
famil
of
wives
and
childr
to

In

to
himself
ever
roasting-pig
runn
about
wi
a

and

the
pigeons
were
snugl
put
to
b
in
a
comfort
pie
,
and
tuck
in
wi
a
coverlet
of
crust
;
the
geese
were
swimm

and
the
ducks
pair
cosil
in
dishes
,
like
snug
marri
couples
,
wi
a
decent

In

not

As

ov
the
fat
meadow

the

fields
of

of

,
of

and
Indian

,
and
the

wi

Na

mount
on
the
top
of
a
wagon
load
wi
household
trumper
,
wi
pots
and
kettles
dangl

;
and
he
beheld
himself
bestrid
a
pac
mare
,
wi
a
colt
at
h
heels
,
sett
out
f
Kentuck
,
Tenness
,--
the
Lord
knows
where
!
Wh
he
enter
the
house
,
the
conquest
of
his
heart
was
complete
.
It
was
one
of
those
spac
farmhouses
,
wi
high-ridg
but
lowl
slop
roofs
,
built
in
the
style
hand
down
from
the
first
Dutch
settlers
;
the
low
project
eaves
form
a
piazza
along
the
front
,
cap
of
be
clos
up
in
bad
weath
.
Und
this
were
hung
flails
,
har
,
var
utensils
of
husbandr
,
and
nets
f
fish
in
the
neighbor
riv
.
Benches
were
built
along
the
sides
f
summ
use
;
and
a
great
spinning-wheel
at
one
end
,
and
a
churn
at
the
oth
,
show
the
var
uses
to
which
this
import
porch
might
be
devot
.
From
this
piazza
the
wonder
Ichabod
enter
the
hall
,
which
form
the
centre
of
the
mans
,
and
the
place
of
usu
residence
.
Here
rows
of
resplendent
pewt
,
rang
on
a
long
dress
,
dazzl
his
eyes
.
In
one
corn
stood
a
huge
bag
of
wool
,
read
to
be
spun
;
in
anoth
,
a
quant
of
linsey-woolse
just
from
the
loom
;
ears
of
Indian
corn
,
and
strings
of
dri
apples
and
peaches
,
hung
in
ga
festoons
along
the
walls
,
mingl
wi
the
gaud
of
r
peppers
;
and
a
do
left
ajar
gave
him
a
peep
into
the
best
parl
,
where
the
claw-foot
chairs
and
dark
mahogan
tables
shone
like
mirrors
;
andirons
,
wi
their
accompany
shovel
and
tongs
,
glisten
from
their
covert
of
asparagus
tops
;
mock-oranges
and
conch-shells
decorat
the
mantelpiece
;
strings
of
various-color
birds
eggs
were
suspend
above
it
;
a
great
ostrich
egg
was
hung
from
the
centre
of
the
room
,
and
a
corn
cupboard
,
knowingl
left
op
,
display
immense
treasures
of
old
silv
and
well-mend
china
.
From
the
mo
Ichabod
laid
his
eyes
upon
these
regions
of
delight
,
the
peace
of
his
mind
was
at
an
end
,
and
his
onl
stud
was
how
to
gain
the
affections
of
the
peer
daught
of
Van
Tassel
.
In
this
enterpr
,
howev
,
he
had
more
re
difficulties
than
generall
fell
to
the
lot
of
a
knight-err
of
yore
,
who
seldom
had
anyth
but
giants
,
enchanters
,
fier
dragons
,
and
such
like
easil
conquer
adversaries
,
to
contend
wi
and
had
to
make
his
wa
merel
through
gates
of
iron
and
brass
,
and
walls
of
adam
to
the
castle
keep
,
where
the
lad
of
his
heart
was
confin
;
all
which
he
achiev
as
easil
as
a
man
would
carve
his
wa
to
the
centre
of
a
Christmas
pie
;
and
th
the
lad
gave
him
h
hand
as
a
matt
of
course
.
Ichabod
,
on
the
contr
,
had
to
win
his
wa
to
the
heart
of
a
countr
coquette
,
beset
wi
a
labyrin
of
whims
and
caprices
,
which
were
forev
present
new
difficulties
and
impediments
;
and
he
had
to
encount
a
host
of
fear
adversaries
of
re
flesh
and
blood
,
the
numer
rust
admirers
,
who
beset
ever
port
to
h
heart
,
keep
a
watch
and
angr
eye
upon
each
oth
,
but
read
to
fl
out
in
the
common
cause
against
an
new
competit
.
Among
these
,
the
most
formid
was
a
burl
,
roar
,
royster
blade
,
of
the
name
of
Abraham
,

,
accord
to
the
Dutch
abbreviat
,
Brom
Van
Brunt
,
the
hero
of
the
countr
round
,
which
rang
wi
his
feats
of
streng
and
hardihood
.
He
was
broad-shoulder
and
double-joint
,
wi
short
curl
black
hair
,
and
a
bluff
but
not
unpleas
countenance
,
hav
a
mingl
air
of
fun
and
arrogance
.
From
his
Herculean
frame
and
great
powers
of
limb
he
had
receiv
the
nickname
of
BROM
BONES
,
b
which
he
was
universall
known
.
He
was
fam
f
great
knowledge
and
skill
in
horseman
,
be
as
dexter
on
horseback
as
a
Tartar
.
He
was
foremost
at
all
races
and
cock
fights
;
and
,
wi
the
ascendanc
which
bodil
streng
always
acquires
in
rust
life
,
was
the
umpire
in
all
disputes
,
sett
his
hat
on
one
side
,
and
giv
his
decisions
wi
an
air
and
tone
that
admitt
of
no
gainsa

appe
.
He
was
always
read
f
eith
a
fight

a
frol
;
but
had
more
mischief
than
ill-will
in
his
composit
;
and
wi
all
his
overbear
rough
,
there
was
a
strong
dash
of
waggish
good
hum
at
bottom
.
He
had
thr

four
boon
companions
,
who
regard
him
as
their
model
,
and
at
the
head
of
whom
he
scour
the
countr
,
attend
ever
scene
of
feud

merri
f
miles
round
.
In
cold
weath
he
was

b
a
fur

,
surmount
wi
a
flaunt
fox
’s
tail
;
and
wh
the
folks
at
a
countr
gather
descri
this
well-known
crest
at
a
distance
,
whisk
about
among
a
squad
of
hard
riders
,
the
always
stood
b
f
a
squall
.
Sometimes
his
crew
would
be
heard
dash
along
past
the
farmhouses
at
midnight
,
wi
whoop
and
halloo
,
like
a
troop
of
Don
Cossacks
;
and
the
old
dames
,
startl
out
of
their
sleep
,
would
list
f
a
mo
till
the
hurry-scurr
had
clatter
b
,
and
th
exclaim
,
“Ay,
there
goes
Brom
Bones
and
his
gang
!”
The
neighbors
look
upon
him
wi
a
mixture
of
awe
,
admirat
,
and
good-will
;
and
,
wh
an
madcap
prank

rust
brawl
occurr
in
the
vicin
,
always
shook
their
heads
,
and
warrant
Brom
Bones
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
.
This
rantipole
hero
had
f
some
time
singl
out
the
bloom
Katrina
f
the
object
of
his
uncou
gallantries
,
and
though
his
amor
toyings
were
someth
like
the
gentle
caresses
and
endearments
of
a
bear
,
yet
it
was
whisper
that
she
did
not
altogeth
discourage
his
hopes
.
Certain
it
is
,
his
advances
were
signals
f
riv
candidates
to
retire
,
who
felt
no
inclinat
to
cross
a
l
in
his
amours
;
insomuch
,
that
wh
his
horse
was
se
ti
to
Van
Tassel
’s
pal
,
on
a
Sunda
night
,
a
sure
sign
that
his
mast
was
court
,

,
as
it
is
term
,
“sparking,”
within
,
all
oth
suitors
pass
b
in
despair
,
and
carri
the
war
into
oth
quarters
.
Such
was
the
formid
riv
wi
whom
Ichabod
Crane
had
to
contend
,
and
,
consider
all
things
,
a
stout
man
than
he
would
have
shrunk
from
the
competit
,
and
a
wis
man
would
have
despair
.
He
had
,
howev
,
a
happ
mixture
of
pliabil
and
perseverance
in
his
nature
;
he
was
in
form
and
spirit
like
a
supple-jack
--yielding,
but
tough
;
though
he
bent
,
he
nev
broke
;
and
though
he
bow
benea
the
slightest
pressure
,
yet
,
the
mo
it
was
awa
--jerk!--he
was
as
erect
,
and
carri
his
head
as
high
as
ev
.
To
have
tak
the
field
openl
against
his
riv
would
have
be
mad
;
f
he
was
not
a
man
to
be
thwart
in
his
amours
,
an
more
than
that
storm
lov
,
Achilles
.
Ichabod
,
therefore
,
made
his
advances
in
a
quiet
and
gentl
insinuat
mann
.
Und
cov
of
his
charact
of
singing-mast
,
he
made
frequent
visits
at
the
farmhouse
;
not
that
he
had
anyth
to
apprehend
from
the
meddlesome
interference
of
parents
,
which
is
so
oft
a
stumbling-block
in
the
pa
of
lovers
.
Balt
Van
Tassel
was
an
eas
indulgent
soul
;
he
lov
his
daught
bett
ev
than
his
pipe
,
and
,
like
a
reason
man
and
an
excellent
fath
,
let
h
have
h
wa
in
everyth
.
His
not
little
wife
,
too
,
had
enough
to
do
to
attend
to
h
housekeep
and
manage
h
poultr
;
f
,
as
she
sagel
observ
,
ducks
and
geese
are
foolish
things
,
and
must
be
look
aft
,
but
girls
can
take
care
of
themselves
.
Thus
,
while
the
bus
dame
bustl
about
the
house
,

pli
h
spinning-wheel
at
one
end
of
the
piazza
,
honest
Balt
would
sit
smok
his
even
pipe
at
the
oth
,
watch
the
achievements
of
a
little
wood
warri
,
who
,
arm
wi
a
sword
in
each
hand
,
was
most
valiantl
fight
the
wind
on
the
pinnacle
of
the
barn
.
In
the
mean
time
,
Ichabod
would
carr
on
his
suit
wi
the
daught
b
the
side
of
the
spr
und
the
great
elm
,

saunter
along
in
the
twilight
,
that
hour
so
favor
to
the
lov
’s
eloquence
.
I
profess
not
to
know
how
wom
’s
hearts
are
woo
and
won
.
To
me
the
have
always
be
matters
of
riddle
and
admirat
.
Some
seem
to
have
but
one
vulner
point
,

do
of
access
;
while
others
have
a
thousand
avenues
,
and
ma
be
captur
in
a
thousand
different
ways
.
It
is
a
great
triumph
of
skill
to
gain
the
form
,
but
a
still
great
proof
of
general
to
maintain
possess
of
the
latt
,
f
man
must
battle
f
his
fortress
at
ever
do
and
window
.
He
who
wins
a
thousand
common
hearts
is
therefore
entitl
to
some
renown
;
but
he
who
keeps
undisput
swa
ov
the
heart
of
a
coquette
is
inde
a
hero
.
Certain
it
is
,
this
was
not
the
case
wi
the
redoubt
Brom
Bones
;
and
from
the
mo
Ichabod
Crane
made
his
advances
,
the
interests
of
the
form
evidentl
declin
:
his
horse
was
no
long
se
ti
to
the
palings
on
Sunda
nights
,
and
a
deadl
feud
graduall
arose
betwe
him
and
the
precept
of
Sleep
Hollow
.
Brom
,
who
had
a
degr
of
rough
chivalr
in
his
nature
,
would
fain
have
carri
matters
to
op
warfare
and
have
settl
their
pretensions
to
the
lad
,
accord
to
the
mode
of
those
most
conc
and
simple
reasoners
,
the
knights-err
of
yore
,--b
single
combat
;
but
Ichabod
was
too
consc
of
the
superi
might
of
his
advers
to
ent
the
lists
against
him
;
he
had
overheard
a
boast
of
Bones
,
that
he
would
“double
the
schoolmast
up
,
and
la
him
on
a
shelf
of
his
own
schoolhouse
;”
and
he
was
too
w
to
g
him
an
opportun
.
There
was
someth
extremel
provok
in
this
obstinatel
pacif
system
;
it
left
Brom
no
alternat
but
to
draw
upon
the
funds
of
rust
wagger
in
his
disposit
,
and
to
pla
off
boorish
practic
jokes
upon
his
riv
.
Ichabod
became
the
object
of
whimsic
persecut
to
Bones
and
his
gang
of
rough
riders
.
The
harri
his
hitherto
peace
domains
;
smok
out
his
sing
school
b
stopp
up
the
chimne
;
broke
into
the
schoolhouse
at
night
,
in
spite
of
its
formid
fastenings
of
withe
and
window
stakes
,
and
turn
everyth
topsy-turv
,
so
that
the
po
schoolmast
began
to
think
all
the
witches
in
the
countr
held
their
meetings
there
.
But
what
was
still
more
annoy
,
Brom
took
all
opportunities
of
turn
him
into
ridicule
in
presence
of
his
mistress
,
and
had
a
scoundrel
dog
whom
he
taught
to
whine
in
the
most
ludicr
mann
,
and
introduc
as
a
riv
of
Ichabod
’s,
to
instruct
h
in
psalmod
.
In
this
wa
matters
went
on
f
some
time
,
without
produc
an
materi
effect
on
the
relat
situations
of
the
contend
powers
.
On
a
fine
autumn
afternoon
,
Ichabod
,
in
pens
mood
,
sat
enthron
on
the
loft
stool
from
whence
he
usuall
watch
all
the
concerns
of
his
little
liter
realm
.
In
his
hand
he
sway
a
ferule
,
that
sceptre
of
despot
pow
;
the
birch
of
justice
repos
on
thr
nails
behind
the
throne
,
a
const
terr
to
evil
doers
,
while
on
the
desk
before
him
might
be
se
sundr
contraband
articles
and
prohibit
weapons
,
detect
upon
the
persons
of
idle
urchins
,
such
as
half-munch
apples
,
popguns
,
whirligigs
,
fly-cages
,
and
whole
legions
of
ramp
little
pap
gamecocks
.
Apparentl
there
had
be
some
appall
act
of
justice
recentl
inflict
,
f
his
scholars
were
all
busil
intent
upon
their
books
,

slyl
whisper
behind
them
wi
one
eye
kept
upon
the
mast
;
and
a
kind
of
buzz
still
reign
throughout
the
schoolroom
.
It
was
suddenl
interrupt
b
the
appearance
of
a
negro
in
tow-clo
jacket
and
trowsers
,
a
round-crown
frag
of
a
hat
,
like
the
cap
of
Mercur
,
and
mount
on
the
back
of
a
ragg
,
wild
,
half-brok
colt
,
which
he
manag
wi
a
rope
b
wa
of
halt
.
He
came
clatter
up
to
the
school
do
wi
an
invitat
to
Ichabod
to
attend
a
merry-mak

“quilt
frol
,”
to
be
held
that
even
at
Mynh
Van
Tassel
’s;
and
hav
deliver
his
message
wi
that
air
of
importance
,
and
effort
at
fine
language
,
which
a
negro
is
apt
to
displa
on
pett
embassies
of
the
kind
,
he
dash
ov
the
brook
,
and
was
se
scamper
awa
up
the
hollow
,
full
of
the
importance
and
hurr
of
his
miss
.
All
was
now
bustle
and
hubbub
in
the
late
quiet
schoolroom
.
The
scholars
were
hurri
through
their
lessons
without
stopp
at
trifles
;
those
who
were
nimble
skipp
ov
half
wi
impun
,
and
those
who
were
tard
had
a
smart
applicat
now
and
th
in
the
rear
,
to
quick
their
spe

help
them
ov
a
tall
word
.
Books
were
flung
aside
without
be
put
awa
on
the
shelves
,
inkstands
were
overturn
,
benches
thrown
down
,
and
the
whole
school
was
turn
loose
an
hour
before
the
usu
time
,
burst
for
like
a
leg
of
young
imps
,
yelp
and
racket
about
the
gre
in
jo
at
their
earl
emancipat
.
The
gall
Ichabod
now
spent
at
least
an
extra
half
hour
at
his
toilet
,
brush
and
furbish
up
his
best
,
and
inde
onl
suit
of
rust
black
,
and
arrang
his
locks
b
a
bit
of
brok
looking-glass
that
hung
up
in
the
schoolhouse
.
That
he
might
make
his
appearance
before
his
mistress
in
the
true
style
of
a
cavali
,
he
borrow
a
horse
from
the
farm
wi
whom
he
was
domiciliat
,
a
choler
old
Dutchman
of
the
name
of
Hans
Van
Ripp
,
and
,
thus
gallantl
mount
,
issu
for
like
a
knight-err
in
quest
of
adventures
.
But
it
is
meet
I
should
,
in
the
true
spirit
of
romant
stor
,
g
some
account
of
the
looks
and
equipments
of
m
hero
and
his
ste
.
The
anim
he
bestrode
was
a
broken-down
plow-horse
,
that
had
outliv
almost
everyth
but
its
vicious
.
He
was
gaunt
and
shagg
,
wi
a
ewe
neck
,
and
a
head
like
a
hamm
;
his
rust
mane
and
tail
were
tangl
and
knott
wi
burs
;
one
eye
had
lost
its
pupil
,
and
was
glar
and
spectr
,
but
the
oth
had
the
gleam
of
a
genuine
devil
in
it
.
Still
he
must
have
had
fire
and
mettle
in
his
da
,
if
we
ma
judge
from
the
name
he
bore
of
Gunpowd
.
He
had
,
in
fact
,
be
a
favorite
ste
of
his
mast
’s,
the
choler
Van
Ripp
,
who
was
a
fur
rid
,
and
had
infus
,
ver
probabl
,
some
of
his
own
spirit
into
the
anim
;
f
,
old
and
broken-down
as
he
look
,
there
was
more
of
the
lurk
devil
in
him
than
in
an
young
fill
in
the
countr
.
Ichabod
was
a
suit
figure
f
such
a
ste
.
He
rode
wi
short
stirrups
,
which
brought
his
knees
nearl
up
to
the
pommel
of
the
saddle
;
his
sharp
elbows
stuck
out
like
grasshoppers
’;
he
carri
his
whip
perpendicularl
in
his
hand
,
like
a
sceptre
,
and
as
his
horse
jogg
on
,
the
mot
of
his
arms
was
not
unlike
the
flapp
of
a
pair
of
wings
.
A
small
wool
hat
rest
on
the
top
of
his
nose
,
f
so
his
scant
strip
of
forehead
might
be
call
,
and
the
skirts
of
his
black
coat
flutter
out
almost
to
the
horses
tail
.
Such
was
the
appearance
of
Ichabod
and
his
ste
as
the
shambl
out
of
the
gate
of
Hans
Van
Ripp
,
and
it
was
altogeth
such
an
apparit
as
is
seldom
to
be
met
wi
in
broad
daylight
.
It
was
,
as
I
have
said
,
a
fine
autumn
da
;
the
sk
was
clear
and
serene
,
and
nature
wore
that
rich
and
gold
liver
which
we
always
associate
wi
the
idea
of
abundance
.
The
forests
had
put
on
their
sob
brown
and
yellow
,
while
some
trees
of
the
tender
kind
had
be
nipp
b
the
frosts
into
brilli
dyes
of
orange
,
purple
,
and
scarlet
.
Stream
files
of
wild
ducks
began
to
make
their
appearance
high
in
the
air
;
the
bark
of
the
squirrel
might
be
heard
from
the
groves
of
beech
and
hickory-nuts
,
and
the
pens
whistle
of
the
quail
at
intervals
from
the
neighbor
stubble
field
.
The
small
birds
were
tak
their
farewell
banquets
.
In
the
full
of
their
revelr
,
the
flutter
,
chirp
and
frolick
from
bush
to
bush
,
and
tr
to
tr
,
capric
from
the
ver
profus
and
variet
around
them
.
There
was
the
honest
cock
robin
,
the
favorite
game
of
stripl
sportsm
,
wi
its
loud
querul
note
;
and
the
twitter
blackbirds
fly
in
s
clouds
;
and
the
golden-wing
woodpeck
wi
his
crimson
crest
,
his
broad
black
gorget
,
and
splendid
plumage
;
and
the
cedar
bird
,
wi
its
red-tipt
wings
and
yellow-tipt
tail
and
its
little
monteiro
cap
of
feathers
;
and
the
blue
ja
,
that
nois
coxcomb
,
in
his
ga
light
blue
coat
and
white
underclothes
,
scream
and
chatter
,
nodd
and
bobb
and
bow
,
and
pretend
to
be
on
good
terms
wi
ever
songst
of
the
grove
.
As
Ichabod
jogg
slowl
on
his
wa
,
his
eye
,
ev
op
to
ever
symptom
of
culin
abundance
,
rang
wi
delight
ov
the
treasures
of
joll
autumn
.
On
all
sides
he
beheld
vast
store
of
apples
;
some
hang
in
oppress
opulence
on
the
trees
;
some
gather
into
baskets
and
barrels
f
the
market
;
others
heap
up
in
rich
piles
f
the
cider-press
.
Farth
on
he
beheld
great
fields
of
Indian
corn
,
wi
its
gold
ears
peep
from
their
leaf
coverts
,
and
hold
out
the
prom
of
cakes
and
hasty-pudd
;
and
the
yellow
pumpkins
ly
benea
them
,
turn
up
their
fair
round
bellies
to
the
sun
,
and
giv
ample
prospects
of
the
most
luxur
of
pies
;
and
anon
he
pass
the
fragr
buckwheat
fields
breath
the
od
of
the
beeh
,
and
as
he
beheld
them
,
soft
anticipations
stole
ov
his
mind
of
daint
slapjacks
,
well
butter
,
and
garnish
wi
hone

treacle
,
b
the
delicate
little
dimpl
hand
of
Katrina
Van
Tassel
.
Thus
feed
his
mind
wi
man
sweet
thoughts
and
“sugar
suppositions
,”
he
journey
along
the
sides
of
a
range
of
hills
which
look
out
upon
some
of
the
goodliest
scenes
of
the
might
Hudson
.
The
sun
graduall
wheel
his
broad
disk
down
in
the
west
.
The
wide
bosom
of
the
Tappan
Z
la
motion
and
glass
,
except
that
here
and
there
a
gentle
undulat
wav
and
prolong
the
blue
shadow
of
the
dist
mountain
.
A
few
amb
clouds
float
in
the
sk
,
without
a
brea
of
air
to
move
them
.
The
horizon
was
of
a
fine
gold
tint
,
chang
graduall
into
a
pure
apple
gre
,
and
from
that
into
the
deep
blue
of
the
mid-heav
.
A
slant
ra
linger
on
the
wood
crests
of
the
precipices
that
overhung
some

it

It

where

,

the
hero
of
the
scene

hav
come
to
the
gather
on

Daredevil
,
a
creature
,
like
himself
,
full
of
mettle
and
mischief
,
and
which
no
one
but
himself
could
manage
.
He
was
,
in
fact
,
not

preferr
vic
animals
,
giv
to
all
kinds
of
tricks
which
kept
the
rid
in
const

of
his

,
f
he
held
a
tract

well-brok

as
unworth

.
Fain
would
I
pause
to
dwell
upon
the
world
of
charms
that
burst
upon
the
enraptur
gaze
of
m
hero
,
as
he
enter
the
state

of
Van

mans
.
Not
those
of
the
bev
of
buxom
lasses
,
wi
their
luxur
displa
of
r
and
white
;
but
the
ample
charms
of
a
genuine
Dutch
countr
tea-t
,
in
the
sumptu
time
of
autumn
.
Such
heap
up
platters
of
cakes
of
var
and
almost
indescrib
kinds
,
known
onl
to
experienc
Dutch
housewives
!
There
was
the
dought
doughnut
,
the

,
and
the
crisp

crull
;
sweet
cakes
and
short

,
ging
cakes
and
hone
cakes
,
and
the
whole
famil
of

.
And
th
there
were
apple

,
and

and
pumpkin

;
besides

I

Happil
,
Ichabod
Crane
was
not
in
so
great
a
hurr
as
his
historian
,
but
did
ample
justice
to
ever
daint
.
He
was
a
kind
and
thank
creature
,
whose
heart
dilat
in
proport
as
his
skin
was
fill
wi
good
ch
,
and
whose
spirits
rose
wi
eat
,
as
some
m
’s
do
wi
drink
.
He
could
not
help
,
too
,
roll
his
large
eyes
round
him
as
he
ate
,
and
chuckl
wi
the
possibil
that
he
might
one
da
be
lord
of
all
this
scene
of
almost
unimagin
luxur
and
splend
.
Th
,
he
thought
,
how
soon
he
’d
turn
his
back
upon
the
old
schoolhouse
;
snap
his
fingers
in
the
face
of
Hans
Van
Ripp
,
and
ever
oth
niggardl
patron
,
and
kick
an
itiner
pedagogue
out
of
doors
that
should
dare
to
call
him
comrade
!
Old
Baltus
Van
Tassel
mov
about
among
his
guests
wi
a
face
dilat
wi
content
and
good
hum
,
round
and
joll
as
the
harvest
moon
.
His
hospit
attentions
were
brief
,
but
express
,
be
confin
to
a
shake
of
the
hand
,
a
slap
on
the
should
,
a
loud
laugh
,
and
a
press
invitat
to
“fall
to
,
and
help
themselves
.”
And
now
the
sound
of
the
mus
from
the
common
room
,

hall
,
summon
to
the
dance
.
The
musician
was
an
old
gray-head
negro
,
who
had
be
the
itiner
orchestra
of
the
neighborhood
f
more
than
half
a
centur
.
His
instru
was
as
old
and
batter
as
himself
.
The
great
part
of
the
time
he
scrap
on
two

thr
strings
,
accompany
ever
move
of
the
bow
wi
a
mot
of
the
head
;
bow
almost
to
the
ground
,
and
stamp
wi
his
foot
whenev
a
fresh
couple
were
to
start
.
Ichabod
prid
himself
upon
his
danc
as
much
as
upon
his
voc
powers
.
Not
a
limb
,
not
a
fibre
about
him
was
idle
;
and
to
have
se
his
loosel
hung
frame
in
full
mot
,
and
clatter
about
the
room
,
you
would
have
thought
St
.
Vitus
himself
,
that
bless
patron
of
the
dance
,
was
figur
before
you
in
person
.
He
was
the
admirat
of
all
the
negroes
;
who
,
hav
gather
,
of
all
ages
and
sizes
,
from
the
farm
and
the
neighborhood
,
stood
form
a
pyramid
of
shin
black
faces
at
ever
do
and
window
,
gaz
wi
delight
at
the
scene
,
roll
their
white
eyeballs
,
and
show
grinn
rows
of
ivor
from
ear
to
ear
.
How
could
the
flogg
of
urchins
be
otherw
than
animat
and
joy
?
The
lad
of
his
heart
was
his
partn
in
the
dance
,
and
smil
graciousl
in
repl
to
all
his
amor
oglings
;
while
Brom
Bones
,
sorel
smitt
wi
love
and
jealous
,
sat
brood
b
himself
in
one
corn
.
Wh
the
dance
was
at
an
end
,
Ichabod
was
attract
to
a
knot
of
the
sag
folks
,
who
,
wi
Old
Van
Tassel
,
sat
smok
at
one
end
of
the
piazza
,
gossip
ov
form
times
,
and
draw
out
long
stories
about
the
war
.
This
neighborhood
,
at
the
time
of
which
I
am
speak
,
was
one
of
those
highl
favor
places
which
abound
wi
chronicle
and
great
m
.
The
British
and
American
line
had
run
near
it
dur
the
war
;
it
had
,
therefore
,
be
the
scene
of
maraud
and
infest
wi
refugees
,
cowboys
,
and
all
kinds
of
bord
chivalr
.
Just
sufficient
time
had
elaps
to
en
each
storytell
to
dress
up
his
tale
wi
a
little
becom
fict
,
and
,
in
the
indistinct
of
his
recollect
,
to
make
himself
the
hero
of
ever
exploit
.
There
was
the
stor
of
Doffue
Martl
,
a
large
blue-beard
Dutchman
,
who
had
nearl
tak
a
British
frigate
wi
an
old
iron
nine-pound
from
a
mud
breastwork
,
onl
that
his
gun
burst
at
the
six
discharge
.
And
there
was
an
old
gentleman
who
shall
be
name
,
be
too
rich
a
mynh
to
be
lightl
mention
,
who
,
in
the
battle
of
White
Plains
,
be
an
excellent
mast
of
defence
,
parri
a
musket-ball
wi
a
small
sword
,
insomuch
that
he
absolutel
felt
it
whiz
round
the
blade
,
and
glance
off
at
the
hilt
;
in
proof
of
which
he
was
read
at
an
time
to
show
the
sword
,
wi
the
hilt
a
little
bent
.
There
were
sever
more
that
had
be
equall
great
in
the
field
,
not
one
of
whom
but
was
persuad
that
he
had
a
consider
hand
in
bring
the
war
to
a
happ
terminat
.
But
all
these
were
noth
to
the
tales
of
ghosts
and
apparitions
that
succeed
.
The
neighborhood
is
rich
in
legend
treasures
of
the
kind
.
Loc
tales
and
superstitions
thr
best
in
these
shelter
,
long-settl
retreats
;
but
are
trampl
und
foot
b
the
shift
throng
that
forms
the
populat
of
most
of
our
countr
places
.
Besides
,
there
is
no
encourage
f
ghosts
in
most
of
our
villages
,
f
the
have
scarcel
had
time
to
finish
their
first
nap
and
turn
themselves
in
their
graves
,
before
their
surviv
friends
have
travell
awa
from
the
neighborhood
;
so
that
wh
the
turn
out
at
night
to
walk
their
rounds
,
the
have
no
acquaintance
left
to
call
upon
.
This
is
perhaps
the
reason
wh
we
so
seldom
hear
of
ghosts
except
in
our
long-establish
Dutch
communities
.
The
immediate
cause
,
howev
,
of
the
prevalence
of
supernatur
stories
in
these
parts
,
was
doubt
ow
to
the
vicin
of
Sleep
Hollow
.
There
was
a
contag
in
the
ver
air
that
blew
from
that
haunt
reg
;
it
breath
for
an
atmosphere
of
dreams
and
fancies
infect
all
the
land
.
Sever
of
the
Sleep
Hollow
people
were
present
at
Van
Tassel
’s,
and
,
as
usu
,
were
dol
out
their
wild
and
wonder
legends
.
Man
dism
tales
were
told
about
funer
trains
,
and
mourn
cries
and
wailings
heard
and
se
about
the
great
tr
where
the
unfortunate
Maj
André
was
tak
,
and
which
stood
in
the
neighborhood
.
Some
ment
was
made
also
of
the
woman
in
white
,
that
haunt
the
dark
gl
at
Rav
Rock
,
and
was
oft
heard
to
shriek
on
wint
nights
before
a
storm
,
hav
perish
there
in
the
snow
.
The
chief
part
of
the
stories
,
howev
,
turn
upon
the
favorite
spectre
of
Sleep
Hollow
,
the
Head
Horseman
,
who
had
be
heard
sever
times
of
late
,
patroll
the
countr
;
and
,
it
was
said
,
tether
his
horse
nightl
among
the
graves
in
the
churchyard
.
The
sequester
situat
of
this
church
seems
always
to
have
made
it
a
favorite
haunt
of
troubl
spirits
.
It
stands
on
a
knoll
,
surround
b
locust-trees
and
loft
elms
,
from
among
which
its
decent
,
whitewash
walls
shine
modestl
for
,
like
Christian
pur
beam
through
the
shades
of
retire
.
A
gentle
slope
descends
from
it
to
a
silv
sheet
of
wat
,
border
b
high
trees
,
betwe
which
,
peeps
ma
be
caught
at
the
blue
hills
of
the
Hudson
.
To
look
upon
its
grass-grown
yard
,
where
the
sunbeams
seem
to
sleep
so
quietl
,
one
would
think
that
there
at
least
the
dead
might
rest
in
peace
.
On
one
side
of
the
church
extends
a
wide
wood
dell
,
along
which
raves
a
large
brook
among
brok
rocks
and
trunks
of
fall
trees
.
Ov
a
deep
black
part
of
the
stream
,
not
far
from
the
church
,
was
formerl
thrown
a
wood
bridge
;
the
road
that
l
to
it
,
and
the
bridge
itself
,
were
thickl
shad
b
overhang
trees
,
which
cast
a
gloom
about
it
,
ev
in
the
daytime
;
but
occasion
a
fear
dark
at
night
.
Such
was
one
of
the
favorite
haunts
of
the
Head
Horseman
,
and
the
place
where
he
was
most
frequentl
encounter
.
The
tale
was
told
of
old
Brouw
,
a
most
heretic
disbeliev
in
ghosts
,
how
he
met
the
Horseman
return
from
his
fora
into
Sleep
Hollow
,
and
was
oblig
to
get
up
behind
him
;
how
the
gallop
ov
bush
and
brake
,
ov
hill
and
swamp
,
until
the
reach
the
bridge
;
wh
the
Horseman
suddenl
turn
into
a
skeleton
,
threw
old
Brouw
into
the
brook
,
and
sprang
awa
ov
the
tree-tops
wi
a
clap
of
thund
.
This
stor
was
immediatel
match
b
a
thrice
marvell
adventure
of
Brom
Bones
,
who
made
light
of
the
Gallop
Hessian
as
an
arr
jocke
.
He
affirm
that
on
return
one
night
from
the
neighbor
village
of
S
S
,
he
had
be
overtak
b
this
midnight
troop
;
that
he
had
offer
to
race
wi
him
f
a
bowl
of
punch
,
and
should
have
won
it
too
,
f
Daredevil
beat
the
goblin
horse
all
hollow
,
but
just
as
the
came
to
the
church
bridge
,
the
Hessian
bolt
,
and
vanish
in
a
flash
of
fire
.
All
these
tales
,
told
in
that
drows
undertone
wi
which
m
talk
in
the
dark
,
the
countenances
of
the
listeners
onl
now
and
th
receiv
a
casu
gleam
from
the
glare
of
a
pipe
,
sank
deep
in
the
mind
of
Ichabod
.
He
repaid
them
in
kind
wi
large
extracts
from
his
invalu
auth
,
Cotton
Math
,
and
add
man
marvell
events
that
had
tak
place
in
his
nat
State
of
Connecticut
,
and
fear
sights
which
he
had
se
in
his
nightl
walks
about
Sleep
Hollow
.
The
revel
now
graduall
broke
up
.
The
old
farmers
gather
togeth
their
families
in
their
wagons
,
and
were
heard
f
some
time
rattl
along
the
hollow
roads
,
and
ov
the
dist
hills
.
Some
of
the
damsels
mount
on
pillions
behind
their
favorite
swains
,
and
their
light-heart
laught
,
mingl
wi
the
clatt
of
hoofs
,
echo
along
the
silent
woodlands
,
sound
faint
and
faint
,
until
the
graduall
di
awa
,--and
the
late
scene
of
no
and
frol
was
all
silent
and
desert
.
Ichabod
onl
linger
behind
,
accord
to
the
custom
of
countr
lovers
,
to
have
a
tête-à-tête
wi
the
heiress
;
full
convinc
that
he
was
now
on
the
high
road
to
success
.
What
pass
at
this
interview
I
will
not
pretend
to
sa
,
f
in
fact
I
do
not
know
.
Someth
,
howev
,
I
fear
me
,
must
have
gone
wrong
,
f
he
certainl
salli
for
,
aft
no
ver
great
interv
,
wi
an
air
quite
desolate
and
chapfall
.
Oh
,
these
wom
!
these
wom
!
Could
that
girl
have
be
play
off
an
of
h
coquettish
tricks
?
Was
h
encourage
of
the
po
pedagogue
all
a
mere
sham
to
secure
h
conquest
of
his
riv
?
Heav
onl
knows
,
not
I
!
Let
it
suffice
to
sa
,
Ichabod
stole
for
wi
the
air
of
one
who
had
be
sack
a
henroost
,
rath
than
a
fair
lad
’s
heart
.
Without
look
to
the
right

left
to
notice
the
scene
of
rur
weal
,
on
which
he
had
so
oft
gloat
,
he
went
straight
to
the
st
,
and
wi
sever
heart
cuffs
and
kicks
rous
his
ste
most
uncourteousl
from
the
comfort
quarters
in
which
he
was
soundl
sleep
,
dream
of
mountains
of
corn
and
oats
,
and
whole
valleys
of
timoth
and
clov
.
It
was
the
ver
witch
time
of
night
that
Ichabod
,
heavy-heart
and
crestfall
,
pursu
his
travels
homewards
,
along
the
sides
of
the
loft
hills
which
r
above
Tarr
Town
,
and
which
he
had
travers
so
cheeril
in
the
afternoon
.
The
hour
was
as
dism
as
himself
.
Far
below
him
the
Tappan
Z
spread
its
dusk
and
indistinct
waste
of
waters
,
wi
here
and
there
the
tall
mast
of
a
sloop
,
rid
quietl
at
anch
und
the
land
.
In
the
dead
hush
of
midnight
,
he
could
ev
hear
the
bark
of
the
watchdog
from
the
opposite
shore
of
the
Hudson
;
but
it
was
so
vague
and
faint
as
onl
to
g
an
idea
of
his
distance
from
this
faith
compan
of
man
.
Now
and
th
,
too
,
the
long-drawn
crow
of
a
cock
,
accidentall
awaken
,
would
sound
far
,
far
off
,
from
some
farmhouse
awa
among
the
hills
--but
it
was
like
a
dream
sound
in
his
ear
.
No
signs
of
life
occurr
near
him
,
but
occasionall
the
melanchol
chirp
of
a
cricket
,

perhaps
the
guttur
twang
of
a
bullfrog
from
a
neighbor
marsh
,
as
if
sleep
uncomfortabl
and
turn
suddenl
in
his
b
.
All
the
stories
of
ghosts
and
goblins
that
he
had
heard
in
the
afternoon
now
came
crowd
upon
his
recollect
.
The
night
grew
dark
and
dark
;
the
stars
seem
to
sink
deep
in
the
sk
,
and
driv
clouds
occasionall
hid
them
from
his
sight
.
He
had
nev
felt
so
lonel
and
dism
.
He
was
,
moreov
,
approach
the
ver
place
where
man
of
the
scenes
of
the
ghost
stories
had
be
laid
.
In
the
centre
of
the
road
stood
an
enorm
tulip-tr
,
which
tower
like
a
gi
above
all
the
oth
trees
of
the
neighborhood
,
and
form
a
kind
of
landmark
.
Its
limbs
were
gnarl
and
fantast
,
large
enough
to
form
trunks
f
ordin
trees
,
twist
down
almost
to
the
ear
,
and
ris
again
into
the
air
.
It
was
connect
wi
the
tragic
stor
of
the
unfortunate
André
,
who
had
be
tak
prison
hard
b
;
and
was
universall
known
b
the
name
of
Maj
André
’s
tr
.
The
common
people
regard
it
wi
a
mixture
of
respect
and
superstit
,
partl
out
of
sympath
f
the
fate
of
its
ill-starr
namesake
,
and
partl
from
the
tales
of
strange
sights
,
and
dole
lamentations
,
told
concern
it
.
As
Ichabod
approach
this
fear
tr
,
he
began
to
whistle
;
he
thought
his
whistle
was
answer
;
it
was
but
a
blast
sweep
sharpl
through
the
dr
branches
.
As
he
approach
a
little
near
,
he
thought
he
saw
someth
white
,
hang
in
the
midst
of
the
tr
:
he
paus
and
ceas
whistl
but
,
on
look
more
narrowl
,
perceiv
that
it
was
a
place
where
the
tr
had
be
scath
b
lightn
,
and
the
white
wood
laid
bare
.
Suddenl
he
heard
a
groan
--his
tee
chatter
,
and
his
knees
smote
against
the
saddle
:
it
was
but
the
rubb
of
one
huge
bough
upon
anoth
,
as
the
were
sway
about
b
the
breeze
.
He
pass
the
tr
in
safet
,
but
new
perils
la
before
him
.
About
two
hundr
yards
from
the
tr
,
a
small
brook
cross
the
road
,
and
ran
into
a
marsh
and
thickly-wood
gl
,
known
b
the
name
of
Wile
’s
Swamp
.
A
few
rough
logs
,
laid
side
b
side
,
serv
f
a
bridge
ov
this
stream
.
On
that
side
of
the
road
where
the
brook
enter
the
wood
,
a
group
of
oaks
and
chestnuts
,
matt
thick
wi
wild
grape-vines
,
threw
a
cavern
gloom
ov
it
.
To
pass
this
bridge
was
the
severest
tri
.
It
was
at
this
identic
spot
that
the
unfortunate
André
was
captur
,
and
und
the
covert
of
those
chestnuts
and
vines
were
the
sturd
yeom
conceal
who
surpris
him
.
This
has
ev
since
be
consider
a
haunt
stream
,
and
fear
are
the
feelings
of
the
schoolbo
who
has
to
pass
it
alone
aft
dark
.
As
he
approach
the
stream
,
his
heart
began
to
thump
;
he
summon
up
,
howev
,
all
his
resolut
,
gave
his
horse
half
a
score
of
kicks
in
the
ribs
,
and
attempt
to
dash
briskl
across
the
bridge
;
but
instead
of
start
for
,
the
perverse
old
anim
made
a
later
move
,
and
ran
broadside
against
the
fence
.
Ichabod
,
whose
fears
increas
wi
the
dela
,
jerk
the
reins
on
the
oth
side
,
and
kick
lustil
wi
the
contr
foot
:
it
was
all
in
vain
;
his
ste
start
,
it
is
true
,
but
it
was
onl
to
plunge
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
into
a
thicket
of
brambles
and
ald
bushes
.
The
schoolmast
now
bestow
bo
whip
and
heel
upon
the
starvel
ribs
of
old
Gunpowd
,
who
dash
for
,
snuffl
and
snort
,
but
came
to
a
stand
just
b
the
bridge
,
wi
a
sudden
that
had
nearl
sent
his
rid
sprawl
ov
his
head
.
Just
at
this
mo
a
plash
tramp
b
the
side
of
the
bridge
caught
the
sensit
ear
of
Ichabod
.
In
the
dark
shadow
of
the
grove
,
on
the
margin
of
the
brook
,
he
beheld
someth
huge
,
misshap
and
tower
.
It
stirr
not
,
but
seem
gather
up
in
the
gloom
,
like
some
gigant
monst
read
to
spr
upon
the
travell
.
The
hair
of
the
affright
pedagogue
rose
upon
his
head
wi
terr
.
What
was
to
be
done
?
To
turn
and
fl
was
now
too
late
;
and
besides
,
what
chance
was
there
of
escap
ghost

goblin
,
if
such
it
was
,
which
could
ride
upon
the
wings
of
the
wind
?
Summon
up
,
therefore
,
a
show
of
courage
,
he
demand
in
stammer
accents
,
“Who
are
you
?”
He
receiv
no
repl
.
He
repeat
his
demand
in
a
still
more
agitat
voice
.
Still
there
was
no
answ
.
Once
more
he
cudgell
the
sides
of
the
inflex
Gunpowd
,
and
,
shutt
his
eyes
,
broke
for
wi
involunt
ferv
into
a
psalm
tune
.
Just
th
the
shadow
object
of
alarm
put
itself
in
mot
,
and
wi
a
scramble
and
a
bound
stood
at
once
in
the
middle
of
the
road
.
Though
the
night
was
dark
and
dism
,
yet
the
form
of
the
unknown
might
now
in
some
degr
be
ascertain
.
He
appear
to
be
a
horseman
of
large
dimensions
,
and
mount
on
a
black
horse
of
power
frame
.
He
made
no
off
of
molestat

sociabil
,
but
kept
aloof
on
one
side
of
the
road
,
jogg
along
on
the
blind
side
of
old
Gunpowd
,
who
had
now
got
ov
his
fright
and
wayward
.
Ichabod
,
who
had
no
relish
f
this
strange
midnight
compan
,
and
bethought
himself
of
the
adventure
of
Brom
Bones
wi
the
Gallop
Hessian
,
now
quicken
his
ste
in
hopes
of
leav
him
behind
.
The
strang
,
howev
,
quicken
his
horse
to
an
equ
pace
.
Ichabod
pull
up
,
and
fell
into
a
walk
,
think
to
lag
behind
,--the
oth
did
the
same
.
His
heart
began
to
sink
within
him
;
he
endeavor
to
resume
his
psalm
tune
,
but
his
parch
tongue
clove
to
the
roof
of
his
mou
,
and
he
could
not
utt
a
stave
.
There
was
someth
in
the
mood
and
dogg
silence
of
this
pertinac
compan
that
was
myster
and
appall
.
It
was
soon
fearfull
account
f
.
On
mount
a
ris
ground
,
which
brought
the
figure
of
his
fellow-travell
in
relief
against
the
sk
,
gigant
in
height
,
and
muffl
in
a
cloak
,
Ichabod
was
horror-struck
on
perceiv
that
he
was
head
!--but
his
horr
was
still
more
increas
on
observ
that
the
head
,
which
should
have
rest
on
his
shoulders
,
was
carri
before
him
on
the
pommel
of
his
saddle
!
His
terr
rose
to
desperat
;
he
rain
a
show
of
kicks
and
blows
upon
Gunpowd
,
hop
b
a
sudd
move
to
g
his
compan
the
slip
;
but
the
spectre
start
full
jump
wi
him
.
Awa
,
th
,
the
dash
through
thick
and
thin
;
stones
fly
and
sparks
flash
at
ever
bound
.
Ichabod
’s
flims
garments
flutter
in
the
air
,
as
he
stretch
his
long
lank
bod
awa
ov
his
horse
’s
head
,
in
the
eager
of
his
flight
.
The
had
now
reach
the
road
which
turns
off
to
Sleep
Hollow
;
but
Gunpowd
,
who
seem
possess
wi
a
demon
,
instead
of
keep
up
it
,
made
an
opposite
turn
,
and
plung
headlong
downhill
to
the
left
.
This
road
leads
through
a
sand
hollow
shad
b
trees
f
about
a
quart
of
a
mile
,
where
it
crosses
the
bridge
fam
in
goblin
stor
;
and
just
beyond
swells
the
gre
knoll
on
which
stands
the
whitewash
church
.
As
yet
the
pan
of
the
ste
had
giv
his
unskil
rid
an
apparent
advantage
in
the
chase
,
but
just
as
he
had
got
half
wa
through
the
hollow
,
the
girths
of
the
saddle
gave
wa
,
and
he
felt
it
slipp
from
und
him
.
He
seiz
it
b
the
pommel
,
and
endeavor
to
hold
it
firm
,
but
in
vain
;
and
had
just
time
to
save
himself
b
clasp
old
Gunpowd
round
the
neck
,
wh
the
saddle
fell
to
the
ear
,
and
he
heard
it
trampl
und
foot
b
his
pursu
.
F
a
mo
the
terr
of
Hans
Van
Ripp
’s
wra
pass
across
his
mind
,--f
it
was
his
Sunda
saddle
;
but
this
was
no
time
f
pett
fears
;
the
goblin
was
hard
on
his
haunches
;
and
(unskil
rid
that
he
was
!)
he
had
much
ado
to
maintain
his
seat
;
sometimes
slipp
on
one
side
,
sometimes
on
anoth
,
and
sometimes
jolt
on
the
high
ridge
of
his
horse
’s
backbone
,
wi
a
violence
that
he
veril
fear
would
cleave
him
asund
.
An
open
in
the
trees
now
cheer
him
wi
the
hopes
that
the
church
bridge
was
at
hand
.
The
waver
reflect
of
a
silv
star
in
the
bosom
of
the
brook
told
him
that
he
was
not
mistak
.
He
saw
the
walls
of
the
church
diml
glar
und
the
trees
beyond
.
He
recollect
the
place
where
Brom
Bones
’s
ghostl
competit
had
disappear
.
“If
I
can
but
reach
that
bridge
,”
thought
Ichabod
,
“I
am
safe
.”
Just
th
he
heard
the
black
ste
pant
and
blow
close
behind
him
;
he
ev
fanci
that
he
felt
his
hot
brea
.
Anoth
convuls
kick
in
the
ribs
,
and
old
Gunpowd
sprang
upon
the
bridge
;
he
thunder
ov
the
resound
planks
;
he
gain
the
opposite
side
;
and
now
Ichabod
cast
a
look
behind
to
s
if
his
pursu
should
vanish
,
accord
to
rule
,
in
a
flash
of
fire
and
brimstone
.
Just
th
he
saw
the
goblin
ris
in
his
stirrups
,
and
in
the
ver
act
of
hurl
his
head
at
him
.
Ichabod
endeavor
to
dodge
the
horr
missile
,
but
too
late
.
It
encounter
his
cranium
wi
a
tremend
crash
,--he
was
tumbl
headlong
into
the
dust
,
and
Gunpowd
,
the
black
ste
,
and
the
goblin
rid
,
pass
b
like
a
whirlwind
.
The
next
morn
the
old
horse
was
found
without
his
saddle
,
and
wi
the
bridle
und
his
feet
,
soberl
cropp
the
grass
at
his
mast
’s
gate
.
Ichabod
did
not
make
his
appearance
at
breakfast
;
dinner-hour
came
,
but
no
Ichabod
.
The
boys
assembl
at
the
schoolhouse
,
and
stroll
idl
about
the
banks
of
the
brook
;
but
no
schoolmast
.
Hans
Van
Ripp
now
began
to
feel
some
uneasi
about
the
fate
of
po
Ichabod
,
and
his
saddle
.
An
inquir
was
set
on
foot
,
and
aft
diligent
investigat
the
came
upon
his
traces
.
In
one
part
of
the
road
lead
to
the
church
was
found
the
saddle
trampl
in
the
dirt
;
the
tracks
of
horses
’
hoofs
deepl
dent
in
the
road
,
and
evidentl
at
fur
spe
,
were
trac
to
the
bridge
,
beyond
which
,
on
the
bank
of
a
broad
part
of
the
brook
,
where
the
wat
ran
deep
and
black
,
was
found
the
hat
of
the
unfortunate
Ichabod
,
and
close
beside
it
a
shatter
pumpkin
.
The
brook
was
search
,
but
the
bod
of
the
schoolmast
was
not
to
be
discover
.
Hans
Van
Ripp
as
execut
of
his
estate
,
examin
the
bundle
which
contain
all
his
worldl
effects
.
The
consist
of
two
shirts
and
a
half
;
two
stocks
f
the
neck
;
a
pair

two
of
worst
stockings
;
an
old
pair
of
corduro
small-clothes
;
a
rust
raz
;
a
book
of
psalm
tunes
full
of
dog
’s-ears;
and
a
brok
pitch-pipe
.
As
to
the
books
and
furniture
of
the
schoolhouse
,
the
belong
to
the
commun
,
except
Cotton
Math
’s
“Histor
of
Witchcraft
,”
a
“New
England
Almanac
,”
and
a
book
of
dreams
and
fortune-tell
;
in
which
last
was
a
sheet
of
foolscap
much
scribbl
and
blott
in
sever
fruit
attempts
to
make
a
cop
of
verses
in
hon
of
the

of
Van
Tassel
.
These
mag
books
and
the
poet
scrawl
were
forthwi
consign
to
the
flames
b
Hans
Van
Ripp
;
who
,
from
that
time
for
,
determin
to
send
his
childr
no
more
to
school
,
observ
that
he
nev
knew
an
good
come
of
this

read
and
writ
.
Whatev
mone
the

possess

and
he
had
receiv
his

pa
but
a

before
,
he
must
have
had

his
person
at
the
time
of
his
disappearance
.
The
myster
event
caus
much
speculat
at
the
church
on
the
follow
Sunda
.
Knots
of
gazers
and
gossips
were
collect
in
the
churchyard
,
at
the
bridge
,
and
at
the
spot
where
the
hat
and
pumpkin
had
be
found
.
The
stories
of
Brouw
,
of
Bones
,
and
a
whole
budget
of
others
were
call
to
mind
;
and
wh
the
had
diligentl
consider
them
all
,
and
compar
them
wi
the
symptoms
of
the
present
case
,
the
shook
their
heads
,
and
came
to
the
conclus
that
Ichabod
had
be
carri
off
b
the
Gallop
Hessian
.
As
he
was
a
bachel
,
and
in
nobod

nobod
troubl

the

remov
to

quart
of

and
anoth
pedagogue

It
is
true
,
an
old
farm

who

be
down
to
New
York
on
a
visit
sever
years
aft

and
from
whom
this
account
of
the
ghostl
adventure
was
receiv
,
brought
home
the
intelligence
that
Ichabod
Crane
was
still
al
;
that
he
had
left
the
neighborhood
partl
through
fear
of
the
goblin
and
Hans
Van
Ripp
,
and
partl
in
mortificat
at

;
that
he
had
chang
his
quarters
to

of

had
kept
school
and

at

Brom

POSTSCRIPT
.
FOUND
IN
THE
HANDWRIT
OF
MR
.
KNICKERBOCK
.
The
preced
tale
is
giv
almost
in
the
prec
words
in
which
I
heard
it
relat
at
a
Corporat
meet
at
the
ancient
c
of
Manhattoes
,
at
which
were
present
man
of
its
sagest
and
most
illustr
burghers
.
The
narrat
was
a
pleas
,
shabb
,
gentlemanl
old
fellow
,
in
pepper-and-salt
clothes
,
wi
a
sadl
humour
face
,
and
one
whom
I
strongl
suspect
of
be
po
--he
made
such
efforts
to
be
entertain
.
Wh
his
stor
was
conclud
,
there
was
much
laught
and
approbat
,
particularl
from
two

thr
deput
alderm
,
who
had
be
asleep
the
great
part
of
the
time
.
There
was
,
howev
,
one
tall
,
dry-look
old
gentleman
,
wi
beetl
eyebrows
,
who
maintain
a
grave
and
rath
severe
face
throughout
,
now
and
th
fold
his
arms
,
inclin
his
head
,
and
look
down
upon
the
flo
,
as
if
turn
a
doubt
ov
in
his
mind
.
He
was
one
of
your
w
m
,
who
nev
laugh
but
upon
good
grounds
--wh
the
have
reason
and
law
on
their
side
.
Wh
the
mir
of
the
rest
of
the
compan
had
subsid
,
and
silence
was
restor
,
he
lean
one
arm
on
the
elbow
of
his
chair
,
and
stick
the
oth
akimbo
,
demand
,
wi
a
slight
,
but
exceedingl
sage
mot
of
the
head
,
and
contract
of
the
brow
,
what
was
the
mor
of
the
stor
,
and
what
it
went
to
prove
?
The
story-tell
,
who
was
just
putt
a
glass
of
wine
to
his
lips
,
as
a
refresh
aft
his
toils
,
paus
f
a
mo
,
look
at
his
inquir
wi
an
air
of
infinite
deference
,
and
,
lower
the
glass
slowl
to
the
t
,
observ
that
the
stor
was
intend
most
logicall
to
prove
--
“That
there
is
no
situat
in
life
but
has
its
advantages
and
pleasures
--provid
we
will
but
take
a
joke
as
we
find
it
:
“That,
therefore
,
he
that
runs
races
wi
goblin
troopers
is
likel
to
have
rough
rid
of
it
.
“Ergo,
f
a
countr
schoolmast
to
be
refus
the
hand
of
a
Dutch
heiress
is
a
certain
step
to
high
prefer
in
the
state
.”
The
caut
old
gentleman
knit
his
brows
tenfold
clos
aft
this
explanat
,
be
sorel
puzzl
b
the
ratiocinat
of
the
syllog
,
while
,
methought
,
the
one
in
pepper-and-salt
ey
him
wi
someth
of
a
triumph
l
.
At
leng
he
observ
that
all
this
was
ver
well
,
but
still
he
thought
the
stor
a
little
on
the
extravag
--there
were
one

two
points
on
which
he
had
his
doubts
.
“Faith,
sir
,”
repli
the
story-tell
,
“as
to
that
matt
,
I
don
’t
believe
one-half
of
it
myself
.”
